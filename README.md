# SubtitlesGenerator

The subtitleGenerator project is a Python project that allows you to add subtitles to a video from its audio. To do this, it uses the following libraries:

moviepy to manipulate videos and add subtitles

pydub to manipulate audio files

speech_recognition to extract text from the video's audio

tkinter to create a graphical interface for the user

To use the project, the user must first select a video using the graphical interface.
The project then extracts the audio from the video and uses Google's speech recognition API to extract the text from the audio.
This text is then added as subtitles to the video, and the subtitled video is saved to a new file.
